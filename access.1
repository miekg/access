.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBaccess\fP \fBUSERNAME\fP [\fIFILE...\fP]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBAccess\fP will print what access \fBUSERNAME\fP has on each \fIFILE\fP. If Access Control Lists (ACLs) are
set on the file they are taking into account. If no \fIFILE\fP is given the current directory is used.
For each \fIFILE\fP given it outputs a line:

.PP
.RS

.nf
\-rw\- miek file # ACL\_USER\_OBJ (owner)

.fi
.RE

.PP
Which states:

.TP
\fB\fC-rw-\fR
the first character is 'd' for directories and '\-' for files. Like ls(1). The next 3 are the
effective permissions (from the mask) for this user (read, write, execute).
.TP
\fB\fCmiek\fR
the \fBUSERNAME\fP given as parameter.
.TP
\fB\fCfile\fR
the \fIFILE\fP currently being printed.
.TP
\fB\fC# ACL_....\fR
explanation on why this user access. If this ends \fB\fCwith -rw-\fR (or any other permissions) it lists
the actual (unmasked) permission.


.PP
\fBAccess\fP can output the following:

.PP
.RS

.nf
\-r\-\- user file # ACL\_GROUP (via "xxxxx" with \-rw\-)
\-r\-\- user file # ACL\_GROUP\_OBJ (via "xxxxxx" with \-rw\-)
\-r\-\- user file # ACL\_USER\_OBJ (owner)
\-r\-\- user file # ACL\_USER  (with \-rw\-)
\-r\-\- user file # ACL\_OTHER

.fi
.RE

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Show the access the \fIgrafana\fP user has on \fB\fCfile\fR the masked permissions are equal to the permission
as expressed in the group ACL.

.PP
.RS

.nf
% access grafana file
\-rw\- grafana file # ACL\_GROUP (via "grafana" with \-rw\-)
